2. Number Guessing Game(GUI) -  It is a program to guess the number (with GUI)


The program for guessing the Number has a winning number which the player has to guess in 5 guesses.

Consider if the player Enters the Number which is too big, then it will recommend that the Entered Number is too big, Enter a smaller number.
similarly, for a small number.

If the Player Enters a number which is around 3 places close to the winning number then the program will recommend that
